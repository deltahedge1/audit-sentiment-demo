# Sentiment and Emotion Inference Applications in Audit

This repository contains code for sentiment and emotion inference applications in the context of auditing. The code retrieves tweets from a major airline, performs emotion detection on the tweets, and provides a better view of the client's position.

## Rational for Research

The future of Audit will need to include more references than just strutured data. One of the ways to do that is to map unstructured data like tweets to a qantitative score and see how they will give a view of the clients enviornment

## Results

The code retrieves tweets related to a major airline and performs sentiment analysis and emotion detection. It provides insights into the sentiment of the tweets, highlighting positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Additionally, it identifies the dominant emotions expressed in the tweets, such as joy, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, and disgust.

The generated visualizations help auditors gain a better understanding of the client's position by analyzing the sentiment and emotions expressed in public tweets related to the airline.
